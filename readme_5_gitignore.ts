/*
    What are gitignore files?
        -It is a file that tells git which files/folders you don't want it to keep track of.
        -In other words, git will ignore them.

    How to ignore files and folders?
        -You just write the name of the file or folder that you want to ignore, but it's a bit more complicated
         than that, because you can use regex to select files and folders.
        -To be honest I'm not that familiar with it so if you're intrested please search on you own on this subject.
        -But it's safe to say that for what we need in this project the current files is enough.
